# Snow Boarder 2D
2D Snow Boarder game made in Unity

Have fun shreddin' the slopes with Jason! Enjoy speeding up, getting air, and doing spin tricks. See if you can get to the finish line, so you can go back up to start another boarding sesh. Watch your noggin, as I've heard a sharp bump can make it feel like you have to start all over.
